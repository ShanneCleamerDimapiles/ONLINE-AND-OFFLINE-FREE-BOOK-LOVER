        "It's her, but it wasn't her" <br><br>

        "Huh?"<br><br>

        "I asked you here b'cuz I need your help about that person" I said, bago inabot sa kanya ang larawan ng isang babae. <br><br>

        "I'll help you with your problem, if you help me with mine." I said, bago gumawi sa isang upuan na nasa harap nya lamang.<br><br>

        "As you can see, that person is my patient."<br><br>

        "Your patient?"<br><br>

        "Yap, her parents suggested me to be her personal doctor but she didn't even cooperate. So I need your help about it."<br><br>

        "My help? How?"<br><br>

        "As you can see this person had a delusional disorder, a type of serious mental illness, which means she need a treatment, psychological treatment to make it up? We need to know her delusion side, or side B presence which is the delusional that cause such as imagination or belief that is clearly false"<br><br>

        "Then?"<br><br>

        "To start the treatment we need to verify the other side of her, para magawa ito I need your help."<br><br>

        "In what ways? Make sure after this, you'll help me." he said, then nilapag yung inabot kung larawan sa lamesa.<br><br>

        His problem is about interaction, he can't make or deal with it on his own. Can't interact well to the other person na bago lang sa buhay nya, madalas nyang nasasaktan ang iba b'cuz of his side na walang inisip kundi ang sarili lang nya.<br>
        Lumaki syang mag isa, natoto syang mag isa and forgotten how to treat the others.<br><br>

        In his young age? Hindi sya nakaranas ng high school life because of his maturity na kung saan after his high school private tutorial dumeretso na agad sya sa pag hawak agad ng company nila.<br>
        In his young age? Hindi sya nakaranas ng high school life because of his maturity na kung saan after his high school private tutorial dumeretso na agad sya sa pag hawak agad ng company nila.<br><br>

        Which is pinag sisihan ni tita, She admitted na masyado nyang prenotektahan ang kanyang anak and forgotten to teach him how to socialized, masyado silang nag madali kaya hindi naging maganda ang resulta.<br><br>

        His top and genius, kaso hindi marunong makisama- kapag-nakita nya na agad ang mali mo in just once? No twice b'cuz your fired.<br><br> 

        Maraming natanggal sa kompanya nila because of him such as tempered attitude.<br><br>

        Hindi sya marunong makinig kaya madalas nahihirapan na sa kanya si tita, that's why His here to had his treatment too.<br><br>

        Aunt wanted me to help him, it's a little bit difficult for me, b'cuz he can interact with me that's why I offer him to deal with a delusional.<br><br>

        Malawak ang kanyang pang unawa pero hindi nya ito ma i-apply pag nasa situation na.<br><br>

        What so difficult about this? It might be dangerous for the both of them, if they didn't handle it correctly.<br><br>

        According to my study, magaling makisama ang patient ko with a delusion but she can't cooperate with her situation and about him? He can cooperate but can't deal with his socialize, that's why I plan to let them meet then fix it together with the help of their parents too.<br><br>

        Bad and good side might came up, pero umagree naman ang both side as long the treatment will end up well.<br><br>

        Muling bumaling ang tingin ko sa kanya bago ngumiti. "I'll help you, if you'll listen and take my advice."
        <br><br>
        "I'll do everything to make my life back."<br><br>

        "That's good, now the plan is..."<br><br>
